Predicting Life Expectancy of a child at Birth

Life expectancy represents the average lifespan of humans. It is crucial to consider this aspect
for each nation as it allows for comparison of factors that one nation lacks in comparison to
another to maintain a high life expectancy rate. In this coursework, the influence of socioeconomic growth on life expectancy is examined based on a variety of criteria such as mortality
rate, total population, health expenditure, income, etc. The data is obtained from a primary
world database that includes the World Development Indicators(WDI). The correlation is
calculated between the response and predictor variables. Missing values are imputed using
mice and median imputation. Using life expectancy as response variable and other features
as predictor variables, a full reduced and best multiple regression model is built on the life
expectancy dataset allowing us to predict the life expectancy of a child at birth.
